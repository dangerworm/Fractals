# Fractals
This was one of the first times I went all in and used graphics on WinForms,
probably in around 2004/05. I was quite interested in Fractals at the time and
wanted to see if I could apply some of the stuff I'd learned.

Apart from the garish colours it turned out quite well, and I go back to it
fairly regularly if only to show people what fractals actually are. This is
probably one of my earlier C# projects but is easily one of the most gratifying.

# Getting Started
Load the solution (Fractals.sln) and ignore the project that doesn't load.
Start the application, then:
- double click on the Mandelbrot graph to update the Julia graph
- click and drag on either graph to zoom in
- click 'Reset' to go back to the start.

Images can be generated if you wish to make a background or a high-definition
image for a print. However, just be aware that changing any settings during
image generation will mess up the contents of the output file.

# Technology
Simple WinForms and C#, nothing more. I want to extend it to 3D at some point
(hence the loaded but broken project in the solution) but haven't had time to
get back into it.

# The Time Wave
The time wave came much later and is far less useful/pretty. It was a few
years after I'd first made the application and tacked it on simply because
it, too, came under the topic of fractals. Personally I'm satisfied that it's
all complete baloney now but for those interested you can find out what it's
for at [Terence McKenna's Time Wave](http://www.viewzone2.com/timewavex.html).
